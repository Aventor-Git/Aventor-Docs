## What Aventor Can Do

With a connected Meta account, Aventor can:

- **Create Campaigns** - Set up new ad campaigns with your generated creatives
- **Configure Targeting** - Apply audience settings (age, location, interests)
- **Set Budgets** - Configure daily or lifetime spending
- **Launch Ads** - Submit campaigns directly to Meta for review

## What Aventor Cannot Do

Aventor does not:

## After Connection

Once connected, you can:

1. **Launch campaigns** directly from the Studio after generating images
2. **Select different accounts** if you have multiple ad accounts
3. **View connection status** in your account settings

## Managing Your Connection

### Disconnect

To disconnect your Meta account:

1. Go to your account settings in Aventor
2. Click **Disconnect** next to Meta Ads
3. Optionally, revoke access in your [Facebook Settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=business_tools) as well

### Token Refresh

Your connection uses secure OAuth tokens that:
- Refresh automatically before expiration
- Do not require you to log in again
- Can be revoked at any time

<Warning>
If your connection stops working, you may need to reconnect. This can happen if you change your Facebook password or revoke access in Facebook settings.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't see my Ad Account">
    Ensure you have admin or advertiser access to the Ad Account in Business Manager. Only accounts you have permission to use will appear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection failed">
    Try these steps:
    1. Clear your browser cookies and try again
    2. Ensure you're logging into the correct Facebook account
    3. Check that your Ad Account is not restricted
    4. Verify payment method is valid
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Campaign launch failed">
    Common causes:
    - Payment method declined
    - Ad Account spending limit reached
    - Policy violation in ad content
    - Page restricted from advertising

    Check Meta Ads Manager for specific error messages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong account connected">
    Disconnect the current account and reconnect with the correct Facebook credentials.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Campaign Delivery

After launching a campaign through Aventor:

1. **Campaign Submitted** - Your campaign is sent to Meta
2. **Meta Review** - Meta reviews your ads (typically within 24 hours)
3. **Approval** - Once approved, ads start delivering
4. **Monitoring** - Track performance in [Meta Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/adsmanager)

<Tip>
Aventor creates the campaign but does not manage ongoing optimization. Use Meta Ads Manager for performance monitoring, A/B testing, and adjustments.
