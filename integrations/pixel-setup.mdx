## What is a Meta Pixel?

A Meta Pixel (formerly Facebook Pixel) is a piece of code you install on your website to track visitor actions like purchases, sign-ups, and page views. In Events Manager, you may see your pixel listed under "Datasets."

<Note>
If your campaign uses conversion tracking (such as Leads or Sales objectives), a pixel is required. Awareness and Traffic campaigns generally don't need a pixel.
</Note>

## Create a Pixel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Events Manager">
    Go to [Meta Events Manager](https://business.facebook.com/events_manager)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Data Source">
    Click **Connect data** -> Select **Web**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Pixel">
    Enter a name (e.g., "My Website Pixel") -> Click **Create pixel**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Website URL">
    Enter your website URL and continue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Installation Method">
    Select a partner integration (Shopify, WordPress, etc.) or "Install code manually"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Install on Your Website

### Partner Integrations (Recommended)

Shopify, WooCommerce, WordPress, and many other platforms have one-click pixel setup. Follow the in-app instructions for your platform.

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the base code from Events Manager
2. Paste it into your website's `<head>` section on every page
3. Add event tracking code for specific conversions (purchases, leads, etc.)

## Verify Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Events Manager">
    Return to Events Manager -> Your pixel should appear in the list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Events">
    Visit your website and perform a trackable action
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Data">
    Events should appear in Events Manager (this can take some time)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use the Test Events tool in Events Manager to confirm your pixel is receiving events.
