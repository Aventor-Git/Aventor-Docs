## Connection Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What data does Aventor access?">
    Aventor only accesses what's needed to launch campaigns:
    - Your ad accounts list (to let you select which to use)
    - Your Facebook Pages (to advertise from)
    - Campaign creation permissions

    We do not access personal data, messages, or unrelated account information.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I disconnect my account?">
    Yes. You can disconnect your ad platform at any time from your account settings or directly in the ad platform's settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are credentials stored?">
    We use OAuth tokens that expire and refresh automatically. Your password is never stored - authentication happens directly with the ad platform.
  </Accordion>
