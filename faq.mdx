## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why am I seeing rate limit errors?">
    Rate limit errors (429) occur when too many requests are made to AI providers. Aventor automatically retries with exponential backoff. If you see this error, wait 30-60 seconds and try again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why don't my generated images have text?">
    By design, Aventor generates text-free images except for any text in your provided logo. This ensures clean, professional ads where you can add your own copy in the ad platform.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why doesn't my product look exactly like the reference?">
    AI image generation creates new images inspired by your references, not exact copies. For best results, upload high-quality product images and use the Style Reference role for aesthetic guidance.
  </Accordion>
