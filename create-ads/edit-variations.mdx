## Creating Variations

Generate variations of a specific image:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Image">
    Click on an image you like.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Variation">
    AI generates similar images with subtle differences.
  </Step>

</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific">
    "Make the background a warm sunset with orange and pink tones" works better than "change the background."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One change at a time">
    Make incremental edits. Large changes in one request may produce unexpected results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reference the original">
    "Keep the product but change the background" helps AI understand what to preserve.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use color names">
    Specific colors like "forest green" or "coral pink" give better results than "greenish" or "reddish."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Edit Limitations

<Warning>
- Edits work best for style and background changes
- AI may struggle with precise object placement
- Text cannot be reliably added or modified
- Product geometry may shift slightly with major edits
</Warning>
