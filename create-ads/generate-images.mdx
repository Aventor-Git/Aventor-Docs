## Generation Process

When you click **Generate**, Aventor creates multiple ad variations using different AI providers in parallel.

## AI Providers

Aventor uses three image generation providers:

| Provider | Strengths |
|----------|-----------|
| OpenAI DALL-E | Photorealistic imagery, creative compositions |
| Google Vertex Imagen | High fidelity, commercial-ready images |
| Google Gemini | Versatile style, strong visual understanding |

Each generation produces images from multiple providers for maximum variety.

## Generation Settings

### Resolution

Default: 2K (2048px base size). Optimized for social media ad formats.

### Aspect Ratio

- **1:1** - Instagram feed, Facebook feed
- **4:5** - Instagram feed (vertical)
- **16:9** - Google Display, YouTube, Stories

## Reference Images

When you upload assets, they're included in the generation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Logo Handling" icon="star">
    - Placed in a clean corner with padding
    - Logo shape, colors, and proportions preserved
    - Logo text is the ONLY text in the image
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Product Handling" icon="box">
    - Featured as the hero element
    - Product geometry and materials preserved
    - AI creates complementary scenes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Style Reference" icon="palette">
    - AI matches lighting and color grading
    - Aesthetic mood is transferred
    - Brand identity elements are not copied
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Generated images are text-free except for any text in your provided logo. Aventor does not generate text overlays. Add your ad copy in the ad platform.
</Warning>

## Generation Time

- Typical: 1-2 minutes
- With reference images: 2-3 minutes
- Multiple providers run in parallel

<Note>
If generation takes longer than 3 minutes, you may see a timeout. Refresh and try again - your credits won't be charged for failed generations.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generation is slow">
    Each generation calls multiple AI providers. Allow up to 2 minutes for all images to complete.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting rate limited (429 errors)">
    This happens when too many requests are made. Wait 30-60 seconds and try again. Aventor automatically retries with exponential backoff.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Images don't match my brand">
    Upload your logo, product images, and a style reference. The more context you provide, the better the results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Low quality or artifacts">
    Try generating again - AI results vary. If persistent, try a different brand description or simpler reference images.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
