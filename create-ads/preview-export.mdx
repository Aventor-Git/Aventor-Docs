## Image Quality

### Resolution

All images are generated at 2K (2048px base size), suitable for:
- Facebook feed ads
- Instagram feed ads
- Google Display ads
- Stories (with cropping)

### Scaling

For higher resolution needs:
- Download the original and use external upscaling tools
- AI-generated images scale reasonably well to 2x

<Tip>
For best quality, use images at their native resolution. Avoid excessive upscaling which can introduce artifacts.
</Tip>

## Adding Text & Copy

<Note>
Aventor generates text-free images (except logo text). Add your headline, body copy, and CTA in the ad platform:
- **Meta Ads Manager** - Add text in ad creation flow
- **Google Ads** - Add responsive text assets
</Note>

This ensures:
- Maximum flexibility in messaging
- Easy A/B testing of copy
- Compliance with platform guidelines
