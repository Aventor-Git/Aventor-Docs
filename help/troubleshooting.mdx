## Image Generation Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generation taking too long">
    Image generation typically takes 10-30 seconds depending on the AI provider. If it's taking longer:
    - Check your internet connection
    - Try refreshing the page and generating again
    - High-resolution images take longer than standard resolution
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Generated images don't match my brand">
    Try these improvements:
    - Add more detail to your brand description
    - Upload reference images (logo, product photos)
    - Be more specific about colors, style, and mood in your prompts
    - Use the edit feature to refine results
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Generation failed error">
    If generation fails:
    - Try generating again - temporary issues can occur
    - Reduce the number of variations requested
    - Simplify your prompt
    - Check if you have remaining credits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Images have wrong aspect ratio">
    Aspect ratio is set before generation:
    - Square (1:1) for Instagram feed
    - Portrait (4:5) for Facebook/Instagram feed
    - Story (9:16) for Stories and Reels

    Generate new images with the correct aspect ratio rather than cropping.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Text in images looks wrong">
    AI-generated text in images can be imperfect. For best results:
    - Keep text minimal (brand name only)
    - Use the edit feature to fix text issues
    - Add text overlays in your design tool after exporting
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    - Refresh the page

## Brand Enrichment Issues

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Brand info is incorrect">
    AI analysis may not be perfect. You can:
    - Edit the generated brand description
    - Add manual context about your brand
    - Upload a logo to ensure correct branding
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Website takes too long to analyze">
    Complex websites may take longer. If it times out:

    - Use a direct product page URL instead of homepage
    - Use manual description as an alternative
